    "# Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through how to create your own basic AFL model, using publicly available data. The output will be the odds for each team to win. The aim of this tutorial is not to teach you how to code; but rather for someone with very little programming experience to understand exactly what is being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For tutorials on Python, and data science, I highly recommend checking out [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) or [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). These are free resources that will provide you with the basics of Python and data science fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will be relatively short. For the full process of a typical data science project, feel free to read any of the predictive model walkthroughs on [Betfair's Github](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models)."
